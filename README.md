# Database Practicals

Welcome to the database-practicals repository! This repository contains a collection of practical exercises from my first-year database coursework.

## About

This repository is a compilation of all the database practicals completed during the first year of my studies. Each practical exercise is designed to reinforce key concepts related to database management systems, SQL queries, and database optimization techniques.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a specific practical exercise or assignment. Within each folder, you'll find the work I have done. Additionally, you may find supplementary materials such as SQL scripts, data files, or documentation to aid in your understanding.
